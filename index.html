        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I recently graduated from UC Davis in June of 2022, I recieved a BA of Psychology and about a month before the commencement ceremony I was really thinking about what the next steps were. When I first started college, at Foothill College, my inital major was Computer Science. However, I quickly became intimidated by it even though I have always enjoyed technology and learning about coding. I thought about this a lot and now it has pushed me to pursue this full stack coding bootcamp.   </p>
