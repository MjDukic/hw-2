        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I recently graduated from UC Davis in June of 2022, I recieved a BA of Psychology and about a month before the commencement ceremony I was really thinking about what the next steps were. When I first started college, at Foothill College, my inital major was Computer Science. However, I quickly became intimidated by it even though I have always enjoyed technology and learning about coding. I thought about this a lot and now it has pushed me to pursue this full stack coding bootcamp.   </p>

<!--section bc it is the work section of page, created class and id for each section so that can generalize in css or specific in css when needed-->
<!-- made seperate class for weatherApp so that anchortag hover can be bigger and so that image can take up more space than the other 3-->
<!--made classes for all anchor tags so that hover can take uo the full image-->
